## About the Simulation

This simulation is a generic UAM simulation. It includes a generic transition aircraft model representative of a NASA Lift+Cruise vehicle configuration.

Some of the key simulation components include:

1. A simulation architecture (e.g., signal buses) that supports the most common rigid body 6-DOF frames of reference (e.g., Earth Centered Inertial, Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF), North-East-Down (NED), Navigation, Velocity, Wind, Stability, and Body)
2. A simulation architecture that contains most aerospace signals/quantities of typical interest
3. A generic architecture that readily supports swapping in and out aircraft models, sensors, actuator models, control algorithms, etc.
4. A wide array of desired trajectory or RefInputs (e.g., ramps, timeseries, piece-wise Bezier curves, and doublets)
5. A nominal gain scheduled (LQRi) baseline, unified controller (same commands across three flight phases). The baseline controller operates in the heading frame (i.e., the NED frame rotated by the heading angle)

Demonstration trajectory flights are found in the `Exec_Scripts` folder. Demo cases include:

1. A simple sinusoidal input case (`./Exec_Scripts/exam_TS_Sinusoidal_traj.m`)
2. A basic lifting hover and transition to forward flight (`./Exec_Scripts/exam_TS_Hover2Cruise_traj.m`)
3. A cruise climbing right hand turn (`./Exec_Scripts/exam_TS_Cruise_Climb_Turn_traj.m`)
4. A takeoff, climbing transition to cruise and descending deceleration to landing using ramps
5. Two examples of piece-wise Bezier curve trajectories:
    - Cruise descent and deceleration
    - Hover climb and acceleration

These demonstration trajectories can be performed by executing `./RUNME.m` at the top level folder. Alternatively, these examples can be accessed by adding the `./Exec_Scripts` folder to the MATLAB path and running the associated execution example script (e.g., "exam_TS_Cruise_Climb_Turn_traj.m" or "exam_TS_Hover2Cruise_traj.m" m-file). Once the "GUAM" Simulink model opens, run the model. Output data is provided by the MATLAB logged signal `logsout{1}`. Many analysis scripts make use of the output data assigned to a `SimOut` structure: `>>SimOut = logsout{1}.Values;`.

Simulation input (fixed) parameters are provided in a large structure `SimIn`, whereas desired tunable simulation parameters are provided using the large structure: `SimPar`. The structure `SimIn`, `SimPar`, and `SimOut` therefore contain the (fixed) simulation inputs, the (variable) simulation inputs, and the simulation outputs respectively. Some basic results plotting can be performed by running the m-file: `./vehicles/Lift+Cruise/Utils/simPlots_GUAM.m`. Simulation results animation (e.g., creation of a .avi file or similar) is available by use of the script: `./utilities/Animate_SimOut.m`.

### Personalization

While the demonstration scripts are available, a user can in general select among subsystem variants through an input structure `userStruct.variants`, then call the `simSetup.m` script to prepare the simulation for execution. The simulation makes use of an input structure: `userStruct` to change the variants of various subsystems (see `./setup/setupVariantStruct.m`) that are used, and to specify various "switches" (see `./setup/setupSwitches.m`). If a user doesn't provide `userStruct.variant` selections, then the default choices (vehicle specific) are set in `./vehicles/Lift+Cruise/setup/setupDefaultChoices.m`.

An example of the available `userStruct` options are:
```matlab
userStruct.variants:
    refInputType: Timeseries
    vehicleType: LiftPlusCruise
    expType: DEFAULT
    atmosType: US_STD_ATMOS_76
    turbType: None
    ctrlType: BASELINE
    actType: FirstOrder
    propType: None
    fmType: Polynomial
    eomType: Simple
    sensorType: None
```

The available options for the `UserStruct.variants` subfields are enumerations specified in the "ClassDef" folder. For example, the actuator type variants available are found in the `ActuatorEnum.m` file:
```matlab
classdef ActuatorEnum < Simulink.IntEnumType
 enumeration
   None(1)
   FirstOrder(2)
   SecondOrder(3)
   FirstOrderFailSurf(4)
 end
end
```
A user can either write an m-file script or simply call (in the MATLAB command line):
```matlab
>>userStruct.variants.actType = 3; simSetup
```
Now the GUAM sim is ready to execute using the SecondOrder actuator model.

#### Reference Input and Trajectories
Users have a few options to provide desired trajectories and basic flight maneuvers to execute. The `userStruct.variant.refInputType` option selects (look in the Lift+Cruise Reference Inputs variant subsystem block at the simulation top level) between: `FOUR_RAMP`, `ONE_RAMP`, `TIMESERIES`, `BEZIER`, and `DEFAULT` (doublets) options. The timeseries is demonstrated in the `Exec_Scripts` folder for the m-files that contain "TS" in the name and they end with the suffix "_traj.m".

A sample use case of the FOUR_RAMP is also contained in the `Exec_Scripts`, where Simulink ramp blocks are used to build a simple trajectory. In this option, the user makes use of an input structure `target` to provide some basic trim configuration information and then provides timing and magnitude for the ramps blocks using the `SimPar` structure. Target fields available for user specification include: `alt`, `tas`, `gndtrack`, `RefInput`, `Rate`, and `stopTime`. A sample script "exam_RAMP.m" file demonstrates the use of both the user-provided target structure, methods to programmatically specify Ramp settings (using `SimPar`), and the RAMP refInput variant subsystem.

Generating and executing Piece-wise Bezier curve desired trajectory is shown in the example: `./Exec_Scripts/exam_Bezier.m`. This script makes use of two options:

1. A user provided PW Bezier trajectory file (e.g., `./Exec_Scripts/exam_PW_Bezier_Traj.mat`) that must contain the structure:
```matlab
>> pwcurve.waypoints = {wptsX, wptsY, wptsZ};
>> pwcurve.time_wpts = {time_wptsX, time_wptsY, time_wptsZ};
```
2. Or a "target" structure input that contains the PW Bezier information,
```matlab
>> target.RefInput.Bezier.waypoints = {wptsX, wptsY, wptsZ};
>> target.RefInput.Bezier.time_wpts = {time_wptsX, time_wptsY, time_wptsZ};
```
along with the associated IC information (see `./Exec_Scripts/exam_Bezier.m` for details). Additionally, a PW Bezier curve plotting script is available `./Bez_Functions/Plot_PW_Bezier.m` for users to see the 3D trajectory, positions, velocities, and accelerations (for each axis) of the desired PW Bezier trajectory.

#### Aero-Propulsive Models
Two aero-propulsive model options are available: a low-fidelity, first-principles-based strip-theory model and a mid-fidelity, computationally-derived polynomial model. The aero-propulsive model is selected using the `SFunction` and `Polynomial` `fmType` variant options, respectively. The "SFunction" variant contains a MATLAB class/object based model that allows a user to build an aircraft configuration (airfoil, number and location of rotors, aerodynamic surfaces, etc.). The current aircraft configuration is a generic Lift+Cruise configuration (for more details, see the contents of the `/vehicles/Lift+Cruise/AeroPro/SFuntion` folder). The "Polynomial" variant option is composed of blended response surface equations identified from primarily computational fluid dynamics (CFD) experiments for a generic Lift+Cruise configuration. The "SFunction" variant produces aero-propulsive model predictions throughout the flight envelope, whereas the "Polynomial" variant model limits may be exceeded and result in errors in some corners of the flight envelope when users ask for model predictions in areas that are not characterized by the response surface equations (the errors that may be encountered are intentional and intended to prevent extrapolation outside of the region of validity of the polynomial model). The polynomial aero-propulsive model executes much faster than the strip-theory "SFunction" variant and is, therefore, the default option (i.e., `userStruct.variants.fmType = ForceMomentEnum.Polynomial`).

Basic simulation execution performance can be viewed via Simulink scopes in the `VehicleSimulation/Vehicle Generalized Control/Lift+Cruise/Control/Baseline` block.

### Simulation Trimming
The (offline) trim routines are found in the `./vehicles/Lift+Cruise/Trim` folder. The top-level trim routine is: `trim_helix.m`. This script was used to trim the overactuated Lift+Cruise vehicle using the polynomial aero-propulsive database. NOTE: the routine could also be used for trimming with the strip theory S-function aero-propulsive model, but the code has not been modified to switch between the models (likely not functional using the S-function model). In the top-level `trim_helix.m` script, the user specifies a range of forward and vertical velocities (could also provide a turn radius). Next, the user provides some quantities needed for the quadratic cost function/optimization (e.g., initial guess, offset, scaling, and free variables). The quadratic cost function used by `fmincon` is: `mycost.m`, and the non-linear constraints function is `nlinCon_helix.m`. The results of the trim table schedule are then saved in a `.mat` file.

### Baseline Controller Gain Scheduling
The gain scheduling m-files are contained in the `./vehicles/Lift+Cruise/control/` folder. The top-level script for gain scheduling the baseline controller (LSQi) is `ctrl_scheduler_GUAM.m`. This script schedules the Longitudinal and Lateral axes separately. A few linearization scripts are available but the main script is `get_lin_dynamics_heading.m`. This script linearizes around a designated flight condition, and other scripts (e.g., `get_lat_dynamics_heading.m` and `ctrl_lat.m`) segregate the linearized dynamics according to desired axes.
